# Visual Product Recognition Group Project
This model and app were created to get 1000 similar product images when a customer gives an image of a product that he/she wants.
This was made as a solution for a competition on AIcrowd.[Visual Product Recognition Competition](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/visual-product-recognition-challenge-2023) 
In here we trained the model with a different kind of backbone to get embeddings of the image and got 1000 similar images using KNN.
We deployed our model in the Google Cloud platform.
The app was made using Streamlit.
