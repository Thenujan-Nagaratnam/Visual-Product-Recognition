## Introduction

This repository contains the code and resources for a Visual Product Recognition system. The goal of this project is to assist in identifying products from images, which can be useful in various domains such as e-commerce, inventory management, and retail analytics.

## Features

- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes advanced algorithms to ensure precise recognition.
- **Scalable**: Designed to handle large datasets and multiple product categories.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the process of uploading and analyzing images.
- **Customizable**: Easily adaptable to specific use cases and datasets.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Thenujan-Nagaratnam/Visual-Product-Recognition.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Visual-Product-Recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Set up the necessary configurations (e.g., API keys, model files).

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset by organizing images into appropriate folders.
2. Train the model (if needed):
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Use the system to classify products:
   ```bash
   python recognize_product.py --image_path /path/to/image.jpg
   ```
